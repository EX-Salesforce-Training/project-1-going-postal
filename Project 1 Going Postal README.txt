Now that we all seem to be connected with Visual Studio, we are deploying Source Objects to our local Orgs.
The Inhabitant Object is giving us some trouble, so w will each create it in our local Orgs for now.
We are also creating the Custom App in our local Orgs for Postal Service Lightning Application.
We are working on our Mini Presentation for Salesforce Community and Heroku for tomorrow’s presentation.

Florence and Melvin each created our new Salesforce Playground for Project 1.
Salesforce did not want to connect to the correct Playground for Florence’s Org. So, that was a struggle. It is not working yet. Florence noticed the  .sfdx folder missing in her Project 1 folder, causing an issue in Visual Studio Code.
Matt already had his Project 1 Playground and Visual Studio connected. He is helping us get our Playgrounds and Visual Studio connections setup.
Individually, we are all looking at the Community and Heroku Trailheads. (This is also helping us setup slides for the Mini Presentation about Salesforce Communities and Heroku.)
Keeping our Kanban board up to date, and adding to it as necessary.

We checked out a Salesforce video on Communities, which discussed the 3 tiers of licenses:
. Partner Community – top tier – Portal ability, used for B2B, Sales
. Customer Community Plus – tier 2 – Portal ability, used for B2B, B2C, but not Sales
. Customer Community – bottom tier – Portal ability, used for peer-to-peer, 1K – 1M users
 
Matt and Florence went through setting up a dummy community so we could see how that would work.
We will setup a new one for Project 1.
Matt going over how to pull in his Postal Service from Project 0 with JavaScript, to give us a base to start with.
All 3 of us are going through some Trailheads individually, to up our skills in some areas we feel we are in need.

Project Time Estimate: updated to 39 hours 45 minutes
