Other Notes: We had a few major problems with losing access to our git during this project, which slowed us down. 
To resolve these issues we needed to go to our Instructor Harvey Hill to help figure out what the issues were and 
how to get our git to work again. 
During this project, other User Stories were being added to the Kanban board as we discussed the project. 
Some functional, some for interest. Not all of these were able to be added to project during the time alotted. Some 
of them we put in our Parking Lot on our Kanban board to look at later for possible refactoring.
Many late nights and weekend hours were added to this project to get this presentable for our Due Date.

Florence Piloted and Matt Navigated for paired programming to get over the code blocks not working in the Account 
Lookup code so we would have functionality from that controller and Visualforce page.
Matt added some more to the Knowledge base, and added a few things to other parts of the community.

styling on the Visualforce pages. She needs to redo her local Org now the git is fixed. The Account Lookup page
is not running through all the code. Matt will help take a look at it with Florence.

to git.

Florence was researching External Style Sheets for the Account Lookup page. After talking with Matt, we decided 
to go in a different direction, and keep the styling Internal on the page. Florence and Matt are doing paired 
programming - Matt Piloting and Florence Navigating. Florence was having some trouble with some of the Trailheads 
not responding. We'll look into that at another time.
Melvin working on Apex and Visual Force Trailheads. He started making an Apex controller for the Tracking system, 
but is having difficulty.

Now that we all seem to be connected with Visual Studio, we are deploying Source Objects to our local Orgs.
The Inhabitant Object is giving us some trouble, so we will each create it in our local Orgs for now.
We are also creating the Custom App in our local Orgs for Postal Service Lightning Application.
We are working on our Mini Presentation for Salesforce Community and Heroku for tomorrow’s presentation.
-
12/02/2020
Florence and Melvin each created our new Salesforce Playground for Project 1.
Salesforce did not want to connect to the correct Playground for Florence’s Org. So, that was a struggle. 
It is not working yet. Florence noticed the  .sfdx folder missing in her Project 1 folder, causing an issue 
in Visual Studio Code.
Matt already had his Project 1 Playground and Visual Studio connected. He is helping us get our Playgrounds 
and Visual Studio connections setup.
Individually, we are all looking at the Community and Heroku Trailheads. (This is also helping us setup slides 
for the Mini Presentation about Salesforce Communities and Heroku.)
Keeping our Kanban board up to date, and adding to it as necessary.

We checked out a Salesforce video on Communities, which discussed the 3 tiers of licenses:
. Partner Community – top tier – Portal ability, used for B2B, Sales
. Customer Community Plus – tier 2 – Portal ability, used for B2B, B2C, but not Sales
. Customer Community – bottom tier – Portal ability, used for peer-to-peer, 1K – 1M users
 
Matt and Florence went through setting up a dummy community so we could see how that would work.
We will setup a new one for Project 1.
Matt going over how to pull in his Postal Service from Project 0 with JavaScript, to give us a base to start with.
All 3 of us are going through some Trailheads individually, to up our skills in some areas we feel we are in need.
