# Getting Started
# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

## Read All About It

- [Salesforce CLI Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm)
- [Salesforce DX Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm)
- [Salesforce CLI Command Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference.htm)

# Usage

Note: Newest info will be inserted on top

Other Notes: We had a few major problems with losing access to our git during this project, which slowed us down. 
To resolve these issues we needed to go to our Instructor Harvey Hill to help figure out what the issues were and 
how to get our git to work again. 
During this project, other User Stories were being added to the Kanban board as we discussed the project. 
Some functional, some for interest. Not all of these were able to be added to project during the time alotted. Some 
of them we put in our Parking Lot on our Kanban board to look at later for possible refactoring.
Many late nights and weekend hours were added to this project to get this presentable for our Due Date.
***

12/12 and 12/13/2020
Florence Piloted and Matt Navigated for paired programming to get over the code blocks not working in the Account 
Lookup code so we would have functionality from that controller and Visualforce page.
Matt added some more to the Knowledge base, and added a few things to other parts of the community.
***

12/11/2020
Florence pulled data types slds from the Lightning Design Systems website lightningdesignsystem.com to use for 
styling on the Visualforce pages. She needs to redo her local Org now the git is fixed. The Account Lookup page
is not running through all the code. Matt will help take a look at it with Florence.
Melvin doing research.
Matt added second community and pushed Service Cloud functionality to it. He added a Knowledge base to the community
and styled the page. 
We also worked on our Portfolios.
***

12/10/2020
We are havig trouble with our git again. Main branch needs to be recreated. We will all need to fix our local
Orgs, when the new master branch is created.
Florence working on styling the Account Lookup page. It is not pulling up records, and parts of the 
display from the Visualforce page are not being accessed in the code.
Melvin finished the Apex package controller and Visualforce page They need to be styled. Going to research 
Sales Cloud to implement this feature. Paired programming with Matt
Matt researching Sales and Service Cloud. He is also working our how to implement the recreated master branch 
and he thinks he fixed what was causing a problem in the git. Paired programming with Melvin. Waiting to work 
with Harvey on how our git can be fixed.
***

12/09/2020
Florence working on styling for Account Lookup. Having trouble with the lookup fields. Unsure what happened. 
Trying to get logo on the page.
Melvin thinks he has the Apex package controller and Visualforce page almost complete. He is trying to use a 
SOQL query, but can't figure out how to pull a specific record. Matt will help Melvin work on that.
Matt pushed List Views for Packages and the Summary up to Git. He is having a problem merging the latest update 
to git.
***

12/08/2020
Florence was researching External Style Sheets for the Account Lookup page. After talking with Matt, we decided 
to go in a different direction, and keep the styling Internal on the page. Florence and Matt are doing paired 
programming - Matt Piloting and Florence Navigating. Florence was having some trouble with some of the Trailheads 
not responding. We'll look into that at another time.
Melvin working on Apex and Visual Force Trailheads. He started making an Apex controller for the Tracking system, 
but is having difficulty.
Matt put Workflow Rules in place, refactoring Approval Processes and Automation.
***

12/07/2020
Matt is waiting to talk to Harvey to help us try to figure out what is going on with our git. 
Florence and Melvin are doing more research to try to get more done on their User Stories.
***

12/04/2020
Matt is trying to figure out what is going on with our git. He will talk to Harvey. Florence and Melvin
are doing more research to try to get more done on their User Stories.
***

12/03/2020
Now that we all seem to be connected with Visual Studio, we are deploying Source Objects to our local Orgs.
The Inhabitant Object is giving us some trouble, so we will each create it in our local Orgs for now.
We are also creating the Custom App in our local Orgs for Postal Service Lightning Application.
We are working on our Mini Presentation for Salesforce Community and Heroku for tomorrow’s presentation.
***

12/02/2020
Florence and Melvin each created our new Salesforce Playground for Project 1.
Salesforce did not want to connect to the correct Playground for Florence’s Org. So, that was a struggle. 
It is not working yet. Florence noticed the  .sfdx folder missing in her Project 1 folder, causing an issue 
in Visual Studio Code.
Matt already had his Project 1 Playground and Visual Studio connected. He is helping us get our Playgrounds 
and Visual Studio connections setup.
Individually, we are all looking at the Community and Heroku Trailheads. (This is also helping us setup slides 
for the Mini Presentation about Salesforce Communities and Heroku.)
Keeping our Kanban board up to date, and adding to it as necessary.
***

12/01/2020
We checked out a Salesforce video on Communities, which discussed the 3 tiers of licenses:
. Partner Community – top tier – Portal ability, used for B2B, Sales
. Customer Community Plus – tier 2 – Portal ability, used for B2B, B2C, but not Sales
. Customer Community – bottom tier – Portal ability, used for peer-to-peer, 1K – 1M users
 
Matt and Florence went through setting up a dummy community so we could see how that would work.
We will setup a new one for Project 1.
Matt going over how to pull in his Postal Service from Project 0 with JavaScript, to give us a base to start with.
All 3 of us are going through some Trailheads individually, to up our skills in some areas we feel we are in need.


Project Time Estimate: updated to 39 hours 45 minutes

Broke project up into 3 Epics:
1. Customer (Community)
2. Service Cloud
3. Sales Cloud
Broke Epics up into User Stories on our Kanban board in Git.
Also, setup a Parking Lot in Kanban for items that we will look at later, if time allows.
Project Time estimate: 39 Hours
